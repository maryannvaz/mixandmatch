                    Have you seen 1995 American coming-of-age teen comedy film
                    Clueless, where main character Cher was able to wake up and simply select matching
                    outfits with a <i>few clicks of a button</i>? Upon watching this film, we both were inspired to realize such 
                    a silly technology. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope that our website 
                    inspires you to achieve <i>your</i> fashionista dreams!
